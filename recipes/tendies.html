    <ul>
        <li>200g chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Some spices of your choice (paprika, oregano, pepper, salt etc.)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>10cl milk</li>
        <li>100g flour</li>
        <li>100g unsweetened cornflakes</li>
        <li>Some frying oil</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise, ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cutting the chicken breasts into semi-fine strips. </li>
        <li>In a bowl, crack the egg, combine the milk and whisk.</li>
        <li>Put the cornflakes into a plastic bag and gently crack them with (something heavy enough to crush it) and put them in a bowl.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour with the spices.</li>
        <li>Put the chicken into the flour first, then the egg mixture and the cornflakes. Repeat twice for extra crispiness.</li>
        <li>Once all of your chicken tendies are prepared, heat up a pot of oil on medium heat (just enough to cover the top of the semi-fine strips) to 170Â°C, if it's too hot reduce the heat.</li>
        <li>Cook the tendies until it is golden brown. This can take up from 7-15mn depending on the size of the pieces. Make sure to check and stir often so it doesn't end up burning / overcooking.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your tendies !</li>
